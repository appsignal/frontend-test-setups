# AppSignal frontend test setups

<!-- Generated from support/templates/README.md.erb -->

This repository contains a set of frontend apps to test with.

## Setup

Make sure you have have a working local Node.js install. The
Node.js version should match the one in the `.tool-versions` file.

The `yarn` package manager should be globally installed:

```
npm i -g yarn
```

Install the dependencies with bundle:

```
bundle install
```

Get started by adding a push and frontend key:

```
cp keys.example.yml keys.yml
```

Open this file and follow the instructions.

## Usage

To install an app:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app:install app=<%= app %>
<% end %>```

To run an app and upload its sourcemaps:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app:run app=<%= app %> revision=<revision>
<% end %>```

Then navigate to http://localhost:5001 to trigger an error.

## Running tests

To run the tests, you must have `geckodriver` installed:

```
brew install geckodriver
```

To run an integration test on all test setups:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Adding a new app

You can add a new test app in one of the framework directories. Add this
line to import a configured `Appsignal` instance:

```javascript
import appsignal from "./appsignal.js"
```

Make sure to use wildcard dependencies in `package.json`. Specify the
major version of the framework you're using, for example `=2` or `=3`.

For the tests to pass a test app should throw a JS error on `/`:

```javascript
throw new Error("This is an error")
```

This error should be caught by the app, the app should render the following text:

```
An error was thrown
```

## Linking a local integration checkout

To do local testing checkout the integrations somewhere, and run `mono
bootstrap` in the directory. Then run:

```
rake link
```

This will link the local packages into all the test setups.

Whenever you make changes to the integrations run `mono build`. If this is
done running apps works in the usual manner.

To undo this step and unlink the packages run:

```
rake unlink
```
