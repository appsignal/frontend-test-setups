# AppSignal frontend test setups

<!-- Generated from support/templates/README.md.erb -->

This repository contains a set of frontend apps to test with.
Get started by generating `appsignal.js` files for all apps:

```
rake global:set_appsignal_config key=<key>
```

To install an app:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app:install app=<%= app %>
<% end %>```

To run an app:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app:run app=<%= app %> revision=<revision> push_api_key=<key>
<% end %>```
